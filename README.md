BuildBattle is a Minecraft minigame designed for small and big servers. This minigame is unique and very configurable, 100% free and open source! 

The goal is to build the best you can! You must compete with other players in this building game. Who will be the best?
BuildBattle 3 is improved version of BB 2 created by TomTheDeveloper. New version created by me (Plajer) contains major changes.
Have fun using it! Leave a good rating if you really like it.
